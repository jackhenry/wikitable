cricothyroid,anterior and lateral cricoid cartilage,inferior cornu and lamina of the thyroid cartilage,,external laryngeal branch of the vagus,tension and elongation of the vocal folds (has minor adductory effect),
arytenoid,arytenoid cartilage on one side,arytenoid cartilage on opposite side,,recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus,approximate the arytenoid cartilages (close rima glottidis),
thyroarytenoid,inner surface of the thyroid cartilage (anterior aspect),anterior surface of arytenoid cartilage,,recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus,thickens the vocal folds and decreases length; also helps to adduct the vocal folds during speech,

posterior,posterior part of the cricoid,muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage,,recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus,"abducts and laterally rotates the cartilage, pulling the vocal ligaments away from the midline and forward and so opening the rima glottidis",lateral cricoarytenoid muscle
lateral,lateral part of the arch of the cricoid,muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage,,recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus,"adduct and medially rotate the cartilage, pulling the vocal ligaments towards the midline and backwards and so closing off the rima glottidis",
